# Ultralearning principles:

- Metalearning. First draw a map:
	- Why
		- Instrumental motivation
		- Intrinsic motivation
		- The expert interview method
	- What
		- Concepts
			- Concepts are ideas that you need to understand in flexible ways in order for them to be useful
		- Facts
			- Facts are anything that suffices if you can remember them at all. You donâ€™t need to understand them too deeply, so long as you can recall them in the right situations
		- Procedures
			- Procedures are actions that need to be performed and may not involve much conscious thinking at all
	- How
		- Benchmarking
			- Finding common ways in which people do it
		- The emphasize/exclude method:
			- Study what aligns with the goal
	- The 10 percent rule for planning
- Focus. Sharpen your knife:
	- Problem 1: Failing to start focusing
		- Pomodoro
	- Problem 2: Failing to sustain focus
		- Eliminate distractions
		- Break the work into chunks
	- Problem 3: Failing to create the right kind of focus
		- low arousal vs high arousal
			- low: for cognitive tasks
				- sleepiness induces lower arousal than this, a loud background noise helps
			- high: for physical tasks
		- start small
- Directness: Go straight ahead:
	- Project-based learning
	- Immersive learning
	- The flight simulator method
	- The overkill approach
- Drill: Attack your weakest point:
	- Time slicing
	- Cognitive components
	- The copycat
	- Magnifying glass method
	- Prerequisite chaining
- Retrieval: Test to learn:
	- Flashcards
	- Free recall
	- The question-book method
	- Self-generated challenges
	- Closed-book learning
- Feedback: Don't dodge the punches:
	- Noise cancelation
	- Hitting the difficulty sweet spot
	- Metafeedback
	- High-intensity rapid feedback
- Retention: Don't fill a leaky bucket:
	- Spacing
	- Proceduralization
	- Overlearning
	- Mnemonics
- Intuition: Dig deep before building up:
	- Don't give up on hard problems easily
	- Prove things to understand them
	- Always start with a concrete example
	- Don't fool yourself
- Experiment: Explore outside your comfort zone:
	- Types:
		- Experimenting with learning resources
		- Experiment with technique
		- Experiment with style
